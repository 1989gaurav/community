Color scheme

Frontpage: Add explaination to why storage files grow rapidly (ie. it allocates faily big blocks at a time)

Data browser is way complicated. Ability to show two nodes at a time and then linking them would be better than current.

Missing remove-icon in property admin for nodes and relations

Clear feedback when a property is saved or unsaved

Clear way of saving properties

Clear way of telling datatypes 

UI Overflow when property value of key is too large

Indicate if there is currently a connection to the server

Charts dont work

Gremlin graph object should not say null

HTML escaping in gremlin console screws up qoutation marks and other html chars

Neo4j jmx bean should be at the top

Only jmx name should be shown in JMX console

Better name for JMX tab

Add understanding for MXBeans

Transaction information should be available in the dashboard

Add clear functionality to terminal

Add upper bounds for terminal lines

KPIs in bottom of dashboard is too detailed (ie. string storage size)

Visualization would be great as a UI for data browser

Fluid browsing of data ftw

Search possibility in data browser

Data manipulation is secondary both to devs and ops

Gremlin console should be "console"

Better formatting support for JMX properties

Show more awesome information from JMX on frontpage (ie. data location, server version)

Notify user that there can be a large discreptancy between node count and actual amount of nodes

Cache hit rate should be readable from frontpage ftw

Read logs in client ffs

Backups very important (Andres, Anders thinks Import for devs, backup for ops)

Import / export with DSL 

Add ability to "show request", similar to show SQL in PHPMyAdmin

Allow searching in defined indexes

Documentation tab

Smaller, more integrated feedback button

Clearly advertize data endpoint

KPIs are kind of hidden on frontpage (perhaps add tabs to the charts?)

Create relationship: one side should be the current node

Create relationship: was allowed to create a self-relationship
  - should be an error

Hit enter from any field when a dialog is fully filled in

Show existing relationship types (when creating a relationship)

Show properties of relationships themselves

Some icons on actions (+ for add node, - to remove)

Differentiate action buttons for data versus other types 

Clarify action relationships

No help on shell console (Gremlin)

Add support for a console language that makes sense

Add easter eggs

Make dashboard clearly advertise that it is Neo4j

Headlines should go away - tabs already title each page

Clearly communicate that this is neo4j, not monitoring and management
