Graph Algorithms
================

Neo4j graph algorithms is a component that contains Neo4j implementations of some common algorithms for graphs.
It includes algorithms like:

* Shortest paths,
* all paths,
* all simple paths,
* Dijkstra and
* A*.

== Introduction ==

The graph algorithms are found in the +neo4j-graph-algo+ component, which is included in the standard Neo4j download.

* Javadocs: http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/graphalgo/package-summary.html
* Separate download: http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/neo4j/neo4j-graph-algo/{neo4j-version}
* Source code: https://github.com/neo4j/graphdb/tree/master/graph-algo

For Maven users, the component has the coordinates +org.neo4j:neo4j-graph-algo+ and should be used with the same version of +org.neo4j:neo4j-kernel+.
Different versions of the graph-algo and kernel components are not compatible in the general case.
Both components are included transitively by the +org.neo4j:neo4j:pom+ artifact which makes it simple to keep the versions in sync.
