Upgrading
=========

A properly shutdown Neo4j database can be upgraded directly to a new minor version. 
Backwards compatibilty is only guaranteed between minor versions, for example from 1.1 to 1.2.

To upgrade directly:

1. download the new server release
2. configure the server to point to the existing database directory
3. cleanly shutdown the previous server
4. startup the new server
