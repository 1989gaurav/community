Deployment Scenarios
====================

Neo4j can be embedded into your application, run as a standalone server or deployed on several machines to provide high availability.

|================================================================
|          | Single Instance       | Multiple Instances
| Embedded | EmbeddedGraphDatabase | HighlyAvailableGraphDatabase
| Server   | Neo4j Server          | 

== Server ==

Neo4j is normally accessed as a standalone server, either directly through a REST interface or through a language-specific driver.

== Embedded ==

Neo4j can be embedded directly in a server application by including the appropriate Java libraries.
When programming, you can refer to the GraphDatabaseService API.
To switch from a single instance to multiple highly available instances, simply switch from the concrete EmbeddedGraphDatabase to the HighlyAvailableGraphDatabase.
