Installation
============

Neo4j can be installed as a server, running either as a headless application or system daemon.
For Java developers, it is also possible to use Neo4j as a library, embedded in your application.

== Server Installation ==

1. Download the latest release from http://neo4j.org/download
   * select the appropriate version for your platform
2. Extract the contents of the archive
   * refer to the top-level extracted directory as +NEO4J-HOME+
3. Use the scripts in the +bin+ directory
   * for Linux/MacOS, run `$NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j start`
   * for Windows, double-click on `%NEO4J_HOME%\bin\Neo4j`
4. Refer to the packaged information in the +doc+ directory for details

=== As a Windows service ===

With administrative rights, Neo4j can be isntalled as a Windows service.

1. Right-click on `%NEO4J_HOME%\bin\InstallNeo4j`
2. Choose `Run as administrator`

To uninstall, run `UninstallNeo4j` as ad administrator.


=== Linux Service ===

Neo4j can participate in the normal system startup and shutdown process.
The following procedure should work on most popular Linux distributions:

1. `cd $NEO4J_HOME`
2. `sudo ./bin/neo4j install`
   * if asked, enter your password to gain super-user privileges
3. `service neo4j-server status`
   * should indicate that the server is not running
4. `service neo4j-server start`
   * will start the server


== Embedded Installation ==

To embed Neo4j in your Java application, include the Neo4j library jars in your build.
Either take the jar files from the +lib+ directory of the downloaded archive, or use the artifacts available from Maven Central.
