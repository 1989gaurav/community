Embedded Neo4j on the JVM
=========================

You'll find some source code in the examples/ directory. These examples 
progress from setting up a graph, to indexing, to using algorithms. 
Scripts in the bin/ directory run the source code against pre-compiled 
classes in the lib/ directory.

The scripts and related source code are:

  * embedded-neo4j                org.neo4j.examples.EmbeddedNeo4j 
  * embedded-neo4j-with-indexing  org.neo4j.examples.EmbeddedNeo4jWithIndexing 
  * calculate-shortest-path       org.neo4j.examples.CalculateShortestPath
