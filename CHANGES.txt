1.2-1.2.M05 (2010-12-02)
------------------------

o Added IndexHits#currentScore which exposes the most recently fetched
  IndexHits item's score from the search, if any.

1.2-1.2.M04 (2010-11-18)
------------------------
o Index configuration handling moved to IndexManager (graphDb.index()) and added
setConfiguration/removeConfiguration which can modify index configuration, but
could render existing index data invalid if wrong settings are modified, so
consider those advanced.

o Made config recognition more flexible for forNodes(indexName,config) and
forRelationships(indexName,config) so that the config can contain differences,
just as long as they yield the same storage format.

1.2-1.2.M03 (2010-11-04)
------------------------

o Added support for modifying index configurations as well as listing
  and deleting indexes and index configurations.

-API

0.2-1.2.M02 (2010-10-21)
------------------------

o Moved to be an official and supported neo4j component.
o The Index API moved to kernel, this component merely provides an
  implementation.
