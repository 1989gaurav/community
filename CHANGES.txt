1.2-1.2.M06 (2010-12-21)
------------------------

o Bridge OSGi LogService to server Logger. Bundle log messages and stdout pipe through correctly.
o Refactoring of functional tests to remove static dependencies. Introduced a server builder to deal with it instead.
o Can now add performance-tweaking properties to the database hosted by the server. It uses the same neo4j.properties file as the embedded version, but you need to add a property: 
  org.neo4j.server.db.tuning.properties into the neo4j-server.properties file.
o Webadmin: Removed component titles, added save button to data browser, minor change to data browser layout.
o Webadmin: Minor UI updates, added error message that shows up when server connection is lost.
o Webadmin: Moved charts into tabbed box, minor UI updates.
o Fixed an issue with initialization order of things in the server to make sure that RRD is initialized when it is needed.
o Webadmin: Added proper tab-like styling to chart tabs and scale selectors.
o Fixed bug in RRD memory usage sampler, making rounding happen at end of calculations, instead of in the midst of.
o Webadmin: Made 30minutes the default view in charts.
o Webadmin: Added kernel version to dashboard, fixed bug in chart drawing (was drawing when the charts are not visible under certain conditions).
o Webadmin: Disallow self relationships in UI, and show error message explaining this.
o Can now load 3rd party JAX-RS jars from the classpath.
o Updated static assembly to properly include both webadmin statics and documentation. Documentation now tested and ships properly down to neo4j-standalone.
o Webadmin: Made the current node show up by default when adding new relations in webadmin.
o Webadmin: Dashboard shows charts with tabs, and allows switching between charts.
o Added a basic readme with instructions for building, running, and functional testing.
o Updating the way to create temporary files to solve the functional test problem where lots of files stick around.
o re-implemented REST to expose indexing of nodes and relationships (new index API)
o single path algo works in RestfulGraphDatabase now
o fixed duplicate paths for delete node or relationship from index
o Http DELETE requires the proper mediatype to accept
o All indexes must be created to use them.
o Added the ability extend the REST API with server plugins.
o Added back links to the first page in the HTML format.
