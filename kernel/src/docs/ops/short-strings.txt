Compressed storage of short strings
===================================

Neo4j will classify your strings and store them accordingly.
If a string is classified as a short string it will be stored without indirection.
This means that there will be no string records created for storing that string.
Additionally, when no string record is needed to store the property, it can be read and written in a single lookup.
This leads to improvements in performance and lower storage overhead.

For a string to be classified as a short string, one of the following must hold:

* It is encodable in UTF-8 or Latin-1, 7 bytes or less.
* It is alphanumerical, and 10 characters or less (9 if using accented european characters).
* It consists of only upper case, or only lower case characters, including the punctuation characters space, underscore, period, dash, colon, or slash. Then it is allowed to be up to 12 characters.
* It consists of only numerical characters, inlcuding the punctuation characters plus, comma, single quote, space, period, or dash. Then it is allowed to be up to 15 characters.
