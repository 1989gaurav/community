File system tuning for high IO
==============================

In order to support the high IO load of small transactions from a database, the underlying file system should be tuned.
Symptoms for this are low CPU load with high iowait.
In this case, there are a couple of tweaks possible on Linux systems:

* Disable access-time updates: +noatime,nodiratime+ flags for disk mount command or in the '/etc/fstab' for the database disk volume mount.
* Tune the IO scheduler for high disk IO on the database disk.
