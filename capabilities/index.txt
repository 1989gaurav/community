== Graph databases versus Relational databases ==

While graph structures in theory are normalizable even in Relational Database 
Systems (RDBMS), this has serious query performance implications for recursive structures 
like for instance file trees and network structures like e.g. social graphs, due to the 
implementation characteristics of relational databases. Every operation over a relationship 
of a network results in a "join" operation in the RDBMS, implemented as a set-operation 
between the sets of primary keys for two tables - a comparatively slow operation and not scalable over 
growing numbers of tuples in these tables.
