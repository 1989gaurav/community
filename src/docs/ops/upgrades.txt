Upgrading
=========

A properly shutdown Neo4j database can be upgraded directly to a new minor version. 
Forward compatibility is only guaranteed between minor versions, for example from 1.1 -> 1.2.
Databases cannot be downgraded. 

To upgrade directly:

. download the new version of neo4j.
. cleanly shutdown the database to upgrade, if it is running.
. startup the database with the new version of neo4j.

Explicit upgrade from 1.2 -> 1.3:

The store format (as well as logical log format) have changed between these two versions.
Upgrading between these two version needs to be enabled explicitly to be performed.
Upgrade cannot be performed if the number of relationship types are greater than 2^16^ (65535).
Upgrade cannot be performed if the configured block size for either dynamic stores is greater than 2^16^ (65535).

. make sure the database you are upgrading will start with the configuration parameter "allow_store_upgrade=true".
. start the database (the upgrade will happen here).
. you can remove the "allow_store_upgrade=true" configuration parameter because it will not be needed anymore.
