${server.fullname} Manual
==================

${server.fullname} can be managed with command line scripts. 

Usage - Windows
---------------

### Neo4j

Double-clicking on the Neo4j.bat script will start the server in a console.
To quit, just press `control-C` in the console window.

### InstallNeo4j/UninstallNeo4j

* UninstallNeo4j - remove the Neo4j service
