${shell.fullname} Manual
==================

The ${shell.fullname} is a command-line tool for exploring and manipulating
a graph database.

Usage
-----

`neo4j-shell [remote options]`
`neo4j-shell [local options]`

### remote options

This is the default mode for neo4j-shell with no arguments. The shell will
attempt to connect to a running graph database server on localhost using
default settings.

Options:

  -port   port to connect to the graph database
  -host   host name
  -name   rmi "name" of the server

### local database

The shell can connect directly to a graph database on the file system.
The database can not be in use by other processes (the shell will complain
that the "store seems to be locked"), unless you access it in readonly mode.

Options:

  -path     path to the database directory
  -readonly access in read-only mode
  -config   additional configuration properties 
    

Getting Started
---------------

Try this:

1. run the `shell-example` script
2. type 'l' to start a local shell instance
3. welcome to the graph, type 'ls' to see the current node
4. 'cd 1' to jump to the related node with id '1'
5. 'cd user96' then hit tab, for tab completion (and then return)
6. 'ls -p' to list just the properties of the current node
7. 'cd' by itself will return to the reference node (your starting point)
8. when in doubt, type 'help' to find other commands

For more details, refer to the wiki at http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Shell,
or follow the steps at http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Shell_Matrix_Example.

To start a normal Neo4j Shell (without example data) use the neo4j-shell script.
