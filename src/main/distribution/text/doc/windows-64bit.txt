Windows 64-bit Support
======================

To run the server on Windows with 64-bit Java, you'll need to install a trial
version of the Java Service Wrapper.

Follow these steps:

1. Download the trial version from Tanuki Software
   * [Java Service Wrapper](http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.com/doc/english/download.jsp)
   * Download the latest Professional or Standard version
2. Extract the contents of the download
   * We'll refer to the extracted directory as $WRAPPER_HOME
   * Similarly, let's refer to the Neo4j Server directory as $NEO4J_HOME
3. Remove `$NEO4J_HOME\bin\wrapper-windows-x86-32.exe`
4. Remove `$NEO4J_HOME\bin\lib\wrapper-windows-x86-32.dll`
4. Copy `$WRAPPER_HOME\bin\wrapper.exe` to `$NEO4J_HOME\bin\`
5. Copy `$WRAPPER_HOME\lib\wrapper.dll` to `$NEO4J_HOME\bin\lin\`

That's it.
