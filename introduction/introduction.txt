Introduction
============

This is a reference manual. 
The material is practical, technical, and focused on answering specific questions. 
It addresses how things work, what to do and what to avoid to successfully run Neo4j in a production environment. 
After a brief introduction, each topic area assumes general familiarity as it addresses the particular details of Neo4j.
 
The goal is to be thumb-through and rule-of-thumb friendly.

Each section should stand on its own, so you can hop right to whatever interests you.

== Who should read this ==

The topics should be relevant to architects, administrators, developers and operations personnel.
You should already know about Neo4j and using graphs to store data.
