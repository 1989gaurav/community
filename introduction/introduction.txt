Introduction
============

== Expectations, Assumptions, and Aspirations ==

This is a reference manual. The material is practical, technical, and focused
on answering specific questions. After a brief introduction, each topic area
assumes general familiarity as it addresses the particular details of Neo4j.
 
The goal is to be thumb-through and rule-of-thumb friendly.

The topics should be relevant to architects, administrators, developers and 
operations personnel. The goal is to provide a technical overview of how 
things work, what to do and what to avoid to successfully run Neo4j in a 
production environment. 

You should already be familiar with Neo4j and using graphs to store data.
