Expectations, Assumptions, and Aspirations
==========================================

This is a reference manual. The material is practical, technical, and focused
on answering specific questions. After a brief introduction, each topic area
assumes general familiarity as it addresses the particular details of Neo4j.
 
The goal is to be thumb-through and rule-of-thumb friendly.

The topics should be relevant to architects, administrators, developers and
anyone trying to take Neo4j from installation to deployment.
