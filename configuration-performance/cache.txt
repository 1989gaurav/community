Caches in Neo4j
---------------

Neo4j utilizes two different types of caches.
A file buffer cache and an object cache.
The file buffer cache caches the storage file data in the same format as it is stored on the durable storage media.
The object cache caches the Nodes, Relationships and Properties in a format that is optimized for high traversal speeds and transactional mutation.


File buffer cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.Quick info
***********
* Somtimes called _low level cache_ or _file system cache_.
* Caches the Neo4j data as stored on the durable media.
* Uses the operating system memory mapping features when possible.
* Neo4j will configure the cache automatically as long as the heap size of the JVM is configured properly.
***********

The file buffer cache caches the Neo4j data in the same format as it is represented on the durable storage media (disk or SSD).
The purpose of this cache layer is to improve read and write performance.
The file buffer cache improves write performance by deferring actual durable write until a cache window is evicted or the logical log is rotated.
This behavior is safe since all transactions are always durably written to the logical log, which can be used to recover the store files in the event of a crash.
The file buffer cache improves read performance by avoiding seek operations on mechanical storage mediums.
Since the operation of the cache is tightly related to the data it stores, a short description of the Neo4j durable representation format is necessary background.

Neo4j stores data in multiple files and relies on the underlying file system to handle this efficiently.
Each Neo4j storage file contains uniform fixed size records of a particular type:

[options="header",grid="none",frame="none",cols="<,>m,<"]
|============================================
| Store file         | Record size | Contents
| nodestore          |         9 B | Nodes
| relstore           |        33 B | Relationships
| propstore          |        25 B | Properties for Nodes and Relationships
| stringstore        |       133 B | Values of string properties
| arraystore         |       133 B | Values of array properties
|============================================

For strings and arrays, where data can be of variable length, data is stored in one or several 120B chunks, with 13B record overhead.
The sizes of these blocks can actually be configured when the store is created using the `string_block_size` and `array_block_size` parameters.
The sizes of each record type can also be used to calculate the storage requirements of a Neo4j graph or the apropriate cache sizes for each file buffer cache.

Neo4j uses multiple file buffer caches, one for each different storage file.
Each file buffer cache divides its storage file into a number of equally sized windows.
Each cache window contains an even number of storage records.
The cache holds the most active cache windows in memory and tracks hit vs. miss ratio for the windows.
When the hit ratio of an un-cached window gets higher than the miss ratio of a cached window, the cached window gets evicted and the previously un-cached window is cached instead.

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[options="header",frame="none",cols="<m,<,<"]
|========================================================
| Parameter                 | Possible values   | Effect
| use_memory_mapped_buffers | `true` or `false` |
  If set to `true` Neo4j will use the operating systems memory mapping functionality for the file buffer cache windows.
  If set to `false` Neo4j will use its own buffer implementation.
  In this case the buffers will reside in the JVM Heap which needs to be increased accordingly.
  The default value for this parameter is `true`, except on Windows.
| neostore.nodestore.db.mapped_memory             .7+^.^|
  The maximum amount of memory to use for memory mapped buffers for this file buffer cache.
  The default unit is `MiB`, for other units use any of the following suffixes: `B`, `k`, `M` or `G`.
  |
  The maximum amount of memory to use for the file buffer cache of the Node storage file.
| neostore.relationshipstore.db.mapped_memory           |
  The maximum amount of memory to use for the file buffer cache of the Relationship store file.
| neostore.propertystore.db.index.keys.mapped_memory    |
  The maximum amount of memory to use for the file buffer cache of the something-something file.
| neostore.propertystore.db.index.mapped_memory         |
  The maximum amount of memory to use for the file buffer cache of the something-something file.
| neostore.propertystore.db.mapped_memory               |
  The maximum amount of memory to use for the file buffer cache of the property storage file.
| neostore.propertystore.db.strings.mapped_memory       |
  The maximum amount of memory to use for the file buffer cache of the string property storage file.
| neostore.propertystore.db.arrays.mapped_memory        |
  The maximum amount of memory to use for the file buffer cache of the array property storage file.
| string_block_size .2+^.^| The number of bytes per block. |
  Specifies the block size for storing strings.
  This parameter is only honored when the store is created, otherwise it is ignored.
  Note that each character in a string occupies two bytes, meaning that a block size of 120 (the default size) will hold a 60 character long string before overflowing into a second block.
  Also note that each block carries an overhead of 13 bytes.
  This means that if the block size is 120, the size of the stored records will be 133 bytes.
| array_block_size        |
  Specifies the block size for storing arrays.
  This parameter is only honored when the store is created, otherwise it is ignored.
  The default block size is 120 bytes, and the overhead of each block is the same as for string blocks, i.e. 13 bytes.
|========================================================

When memory mapped buffers are used (`use_memory_mapped_buffers = true`) the heap size of the JVM must be smaller than the total available memory of the computer, minus the total amount of memory used for the buffers.
When heap buffers are used (`use_memory_mapped_buffers = false`) the heap size of the JVM must be large enough to contain all the buffers, plus the runtime heap memory requirements of the application and the object cache.

When reading the configuration parameters on startup Neo4j will automatically configure that parameters that are not specified.
The cache sizes will be configured based on the available memory on the computer, how much is used by the JVM heap and how large the storage files are.

Object cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.Quick info
***********
* Somtimes called _high level cache_.
* Caches the Neo4j data in a form optimized for fast traversal, close to the object oriented Neo4j API.
***********

The object cache caches individual Nodes and Relationships and their properties in a form that is optimized for fast traversal of the graph.
The content of this cache are objects with a representation geared towards supporting the Neo4j object API and graph traversals.
Reading from this cache is 5 to 10 times faster than reading from the file buffer cache.
This cache is contained in the heap of the JVM and the size is adapted to the current amount of available heap memory.
