High Availability
=================

Neo4j High Availability or “Neo4j HA” provides two main features.

* Enable a fault-tolerant database architecture, where several Neo4j slave databases can be configured to be exact replicas of a single Neo4j master database.
  This allows the end-user system to be fully functional and both read and write to the database in the event of hardware failure.
* Enable a horizontally scaling read-mostly architecture that enables the system to handle more read load than a single Neo4j database instance can handle.
