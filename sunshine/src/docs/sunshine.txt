Sunshine Query Language
=======================

Sunshine queries consist of a few different parts. Let's go through them in order.

== START ==
Queries have start points. It could be that you know the id of one of of the nodes, or have an index search as the start point for a query.

If you want to use ids as start points, you write like this:

[source,shell]
----
START a=(1,2,3,4)
----

This means that the variable a will be bound to first node with id 1, then the node with id 2, and so on.

You can also have relationships as start points, like this:

[source,shell]
----
START a=<1,2,3,4>
----

This query will bind a to relationship with id i, then 2, and so on.

You might also want to use an index search as start point. To use node indexes, you do:

[source,shell]
----
START a=(index, key, "value")
----

This will bind a to whatever nodes are found by the exact index query above.
