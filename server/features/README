This directory is the default cucumber feature test folder. Tests put in this folder will 
be automatically picked up on and run as feature tests. 

This directory is empty for that very reason. We want to be able to run single tests, and
that does not appear to be possible when tests are present in this folder (they get run no matter what).

Instead, feature tests are located here:

    src/features/

With default configuration, feature tests within that folder will also all be run automatically,
but we can also run single tests from there, like this:

    mvn integration-test -Dtests=web -DcukeArgs=src/features/webadmin/console.feature:6
