REST API
========

The Neo4j REST API is designed with discoverability in mind, so that you can start with a +GET /+ and from there discover URIs to perform other requests.
Examples below uses URIs for examples; they are subject to change in the future, so for future-proofness _discover URIs where possible_, instead of relying on the current layout.
The default representation is http://www.json.org/[json], both for responses and for data sent with +POST+/+PUT+ requests.

Below follows a listing of ways to interact with the REST API.
You can also see a (at runtime) generated description of the API be pointing your browser to the (exact URI may vary) http://localhost:7474/db/data/application.wadl

To interact with the JSON interface you must explicitly set the request header +Accept:application/json+ for those requests that responds with data.
You should also set the header +Content-Type:application/json+ if your request sends data, for example when you're creating a relationship.
