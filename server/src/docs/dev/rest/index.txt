[[rest-api-relationships]]
== Relationships ==

The general pattern to get relationships is:
[source]
GET http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/123/relationships/{dir}/{-list|&|types}

Where +dir+ is one of +all+, +in+, +out+ and +types+ is an ampersand-separated list of types.
See the examples below for more information.

[[rest-api-indexes]]
== Indexes ==

An index can contain either nodes or relationships.

NOTE: To create an index with default configuration, simply start using it by adding nodes/relationships to it. It will then be automatically created for you.

What default configuration means depends on how you have configured your database.
If you haven't changed any indexing configuration, it means the indexes will be using a Lucene-based backend.

If you want to customize the index settings, see <<rest-api-create-node-index-with-configuration>>.
