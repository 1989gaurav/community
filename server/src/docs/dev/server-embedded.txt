Using the server with an embedded database
==========================================

Even if you are using the Neo4j Java API directly, for instance via EmbeddedGraphDatabase or HighlyAvailableGraphDatabase, you can still use the features the server provides.

The neo4j server exposes a class called WrappingNeoServerBootstrapper, which is
capable of starting a neo4j server in the same process as your application, using an 
AbstractGraphDatabase instance you provide.

This gives your application, among other things, the REST API, statistics gathering and 
the web administration interface that comes with the server.

.Usage example
[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-server
source=org/neo4j/server/WrappingNeoServerBootstrapperTest.java
tag=usingWrappingNeoServerBootstrapper
classifier=test-sources

Providing custom configuration
------------------------------

You can modify the server settings programmatically and, within reason, the same settings
are available to you here as those outlined in the <<server-configuration, Server Configuration chapter>>.

The settings that are not available (or rather, that are ignored) are those that concern
the underlying database, such as database location and database configuration path.

.Custom config example
