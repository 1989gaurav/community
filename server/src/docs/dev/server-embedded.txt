Using the server with an embedded database
===================

You can programmatically start a server from within an existing JVM-based application, giving
it an already existing EmbeddedGraphDatabase or HighlyAvailableGraphDatabase instance to use.

This lets you build applications using the core neo4j APIs, while simultaneously running the server, 
letting you use the REST API and the web administration live with your running application.
